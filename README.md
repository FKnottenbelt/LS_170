Lauch School Backend Course Work - 170 - Web Development

# Curriculum Summary
This course will cover server side development from first principles.
We won't use any frameworks, and will focus on the HTTP request/response
cycle. After this course, you'll have a good understanding of HTTP,
the protocol behind the internet. You'll also have built your first
dynamic web application from scratch. Finally, we'll talk about various
deployment options, and deploy the application to Heroku.
