Let's start by making this bunch of divs into a grid. Set the display
property of the div with class grid to the value necessary to make it
a CSS grid.

2
Structure the grid to have four columns â€” the first two each taking
up 25% of the total width, the third column taking up two-thirds of
the remaining space, and the last column taking up the last third of
the remaining space.

3
Give the grid two rows, both 200px in size.

4
Put a 10px gap in between the rows of the grid and a 15px gap in between
the columns of the grid.

5 
Make the box with class a take up the first two columns of the grid. 

6
Make the box with class a take up the first two rows of the grid.

In style.css, add a display property to the .grid element and set it to grid.

Use grid-template-columns with 25% as the first two parameters, then use fr
to split the remaining two columns appropriately.

You can use the grid-template-rows property to do this.
no comma

You can use the grid-row-gap property to put a gap between rows and the
grid-column-gap between columns.

It should start at column 1 and span 2 columns.

It should start at row 1 and end before row 3.
