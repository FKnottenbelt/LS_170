HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is a system of rules, a protocol,
that serve as a link between applications and the transfer of hypertext
documents. Stated differently, it's an agreement, or message format,
of how machines communicate with each other. HTTP follows a simple
model where a client makes a request to a server and waits for a
response. Hence, it's referred to as a request response protocol.
Think of the request and the response as text messages, or strings,
which follow a standard format that the other machine can understand.
