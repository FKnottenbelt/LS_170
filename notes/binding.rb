# ERB gets variables from a Binding, an object that provides access to
# the instance methods and variables that are owned by another object.
# If you do not specify a Binding, the result() method gets a Binding from
# the top-level object, which will probably own very little. Fortunately,
# every Ruby class has a private binding() instance method to provide
# Bindings that points to itself, so we can easily extend any object to
# provide ERB with a Binding.

# To enable ERB to use the variables from a separate object, we must first
# ensure that it has a public method to provide a Binding. We can then get
# a Binding at any later point:

class ShoppingList
  attr_accessor :items

  def initialize(items)
    @items = items
  end

  # Expose private binding() method.
  def get_binding
    binding()
  end

  <html>
    <body>
      <h2>Shopping List</h2>
      <p><em><%= items.join(", ") %></em></p>
    </body>
  </html>
  )

list = ShoppingList.new(items)
renderer = ERB.new(template)

puts eval("items", list.get_binding)

puts output = renderer.result(list.get_binding)

# =>
# bread
# milk

#   <html>
#     <body>
#       <h2>Shopping List</h2>
#       <p><em>bread, milk</em></p>
#     </body>
#   </html>

puts ("####################################################")

# If the ERB object is enclosed in a method, and we want it to use the
# variables of the host object, we get a Binding for the host like this:

erb_template = %(
  <html>
    <body>
      <h2 style="color: red"><%= message %></h2>
    </body>
  </html>
)

def erb(filename, local = {}, template)
  b = binding

  puts eval("message", b) # nil, since message is assigned anything

  message = local[:message]

  puts eval("message", b) # Hello World!

  content = template
  ERB.new(content).result(b)
end

puts erb('index', {message: 'Hello World!'}, erb_template)

# =>
  # <html>
  #   <body>
  #     <h2 style="color: red">Hello World!</h2>
  #   </body>
  # </html>

puts ("####################################################")

# But just defining the binding at the last moment works just as well:

def erb(filename, local = {}, template)
  message = local[:message]

  content = template
  ERB.new(content).result(binding)
end

puts erb('index', {message: 'Hello World!'}, erb_template)
# =>
  # <html>
  #   <body>
  #     <h2 style="color: red">Hello World!</h2>
  #   </body>
  # </html>
