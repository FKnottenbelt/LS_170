# In order to use ERB we need to require it, define an ERB template,
# and make any variables used in the template known as local variables
# in our route:
get "/monstas/:name" do
  #ERB.new("<h1>Hello <%= params[:name] %></h1>").result(binding)

  # If we specify a key :locals and give it another hash, then Sinatra will make
  # each key/value pair on this hash available as local variables
  #erb "<h1>Hello <%= name %></h1>", { :locals => { :name => params[:name] } }

  # since params already is a hash, and it already has the key name defined, we
  # can also just say
  erb "<h1>Hello <%= name %></h1>", { :locals => params }
end



# run this by simply doing $ ruby monstas_02_erb.rb
